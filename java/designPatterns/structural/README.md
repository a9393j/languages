# Structural Design Patterns

## Overview
Structural design patterns focus on object composition and relationships between entities. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to do the same. They deal with the composition of classes and objects.

## Patterns in This Category

### 1. **Adapter**
- **Purpose**: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Use Case**: Integrating legacy car systems with modern interfaces
- **Key Components**: Target Interface, Adaptee, Adapter

### 2. **Bridge**
- **Purpose**: Decouple abstraction from implementation
- **Use Case**: Separating car types from engine types
- **Key Components**: Abstraction, Refined Abstraction, Implementor, Concrete Implementor

### 3. **Composite**
- **Purpose**: Compose objects into tree structures
- **Use Case**: Representing car parts and assemblies
- **Key Components**: Component, Leaf, Composite

### 4. **Decorator**
- **Purpose**: Add new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Use Case**: Adding features to cars (navigation, sunroof)
- **Key Components**: Component, Concrete Component, Decorator, Concrete Decorator

### 5. **Facade**
- **Purpose**: Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Use Case**: Simplifying car system operations
- **Key Components**: Facade, Subsystem Classes

### 6. **Flyweight**
- **Purpose**: Reduce memory usage by sharing common state
- **Use Case**: Sharing car color information across multiple cars
- **Key Components**: Flyweight, Flyweight Factory, Context

### 7. **Proxy**
- **Purpose**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object
- **Use Case**: Lazy loading of car objects
- **Key Components**: Subject, Real Subject, Proxy

## Common Characteristics

### Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify object relationships
- **Reusability**: Structural patterns can be reused
- **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific components
- **Performance**: Some patterns improve performance (e.g., Flyweight)

### When to Use
- When you need to change how objects are structured
- When you want to add new functionality without changing existing code
- When you need to optimize memory usage
- When you want to simplify complex interfaces

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each pattern has a specific structural concern
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend with new structures
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use

## Implementation Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Understand the structural requirements
2. **Keep It Simple**: Don't over-engineer object relationships
3. **Document Intent**: Make the pattern's purpose clear
4. **Consider Performance**: Some patterns may have overhead

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overuse**: Don't use patterns where simple relationships suffice
2. **Complexity**: Some patterns can add unnecessary complexity
3. **Memory Management**: Be careful with object lifecycle management
4. **Debugging**: Complex structures can be hard to debug

## Pattern Selection Guide

### Use **Adapter** when:
- You have an existing class with an incompatible interface
- You want to reuse existing code without modification
- You need to integrate with third-party libraries

### Use **Bridge** when:
- You want to avoid a permanent binding between abstraction and implementation
- Both abstraction and implementation should be extensible
- Changes in implementation should not affect client code

### Use **Composite** when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies
- You want clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
- You want to add new types of components easily

### Use **Decorator** when:
- You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- You want to avoid subclassing for extending functionality
- You want to add or remove responsibilities at runtime

### Use **Facade** when:
- You want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- You want to decouple clients from subsystem classes
- You want to layer your subsystems

### Use **Flyweight** when:
- You have a large number of objects that share common state
- Memory usage is a concern
- You want to reduce the cost of creating objects

### Use **Proxy** when:
- You need to control access to an object
- You want to add functionality before/after accessing an object
- You want to defer the creation of expensive objects
