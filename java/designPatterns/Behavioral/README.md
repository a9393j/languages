# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview
Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility. They help make communication between objects flexible and loosely coupled.

## Patterns in This Category

### 1. **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Purpose**: Pass requests along a chain of handlers
- **Use Case**: Car manufacturing assembly line
- **Key Components**: Handler, Concrete Handlers, Client

### 2. **Command**
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object
- **Use Case**: Car remote control system
- **Key Components**: Command, Concrete Commands, Invoker, Receiver

### 3. **Interpreter**
- **Purpose**: Define a grammar and interpret sentences
- **Use Case**: Car command language interpreter
- **Key Components**: Abstract Expression, Terminal Expression, Context

### 4. **Iterator**
- **Purpose**: Access elements of a collection without exposing its structure
- **Use Case**: Iterating through car collections
- **Key Components**: Iterator, Concrete Iterator, Aggregate

### 5. **Mediator**
- **Purpose**: Define an object that encapsulates how objects interact
- **Use Case**: Car control system coordination
- **Key Components**: Mediator, Concrete Mediator, Colleague

### 6. **Memento**
- **Purpose**: Capture and restore an object's internal state
- **Use Case**: Car state history management
- **Key Components**: Originator, Memento, Caretaker

### 7. **Observer**
- **Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Use Case**: Car dealer notification system
- **Key Components**: Subject, Observer, Concrete Subject, Concrete Observer

### 8. **State**
- **Purpose**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
- **Use Case**: Car state management (idle, running, stopped)
- **Key Components**: Context, State, Concrete States

### 9. **Strategy**
- **Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **Use Case**: Different driving strategies (eco, normal, sport)
- **Key Components**: Strategy, Concrete Strategies, Context

### 10. **Template Method**
- **Purpose**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method
- **Use Case**: Car manufacturing process template
- **Key Components**: Abstract Class, Concrete Classes

### 11. **Visitor**
- **Purpose**: Separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on
- **Use Case**: Car component inspection and maintenance
- **Key Components**: Visitor, Concrete Visitors, Element, Concrete Elements

## Common Characteristics

### Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Objects interact without tight dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify behavior without changing structure
- **Reusability**: Behavioral patterns can be reused across different contexts
- **Maintainability**: Changes to behavior are localized

### When to Use
- When you need to change how objects interact
- When you want to avoid tight coupling between objects
- When you need to add new behaviors without modifying existing code
- When you want to make object communication more flexible

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each pattern has a specific behavioral concern
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend with new behaviors
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use

## Implementation Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Understand the problem before selecting a pattern
2. **Keep It Simple**: Don't over-engineer with patterns
3. **Document Intent**: Make the pattern's purpose clear in code
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Behavioral patterns can be complex to test

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overuse**: Don't use patterns where simple solutions suffice
2. **Complexity**: Some patterns can add unnecessary complexity
3. **Performance**: Some patterns may have performance overhead
4. **Debugging**: Complex interactions can be hard to debug
