# State Pattern

## Overview
The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. It encapsulates state-dependent behavior and state transitions in separate classes.

## Problem
When you need to:
- Handle complex state-dependent behavior
- Avoid large conditional statements based on object state
- Ensure state transitions are explicit and well-defined
- Make state changes more maintainable and extensible
- Represent different states as separate classes

## Solution
The State pattern suggests creating separate state classes for each state of the object and delegating state-specific behavior to these classes. The context object maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific operations to the current state object.

## Structure
```
Context (Car)
    |
    +-- State (CarState)
            |
            +-- ConcreteState (IdleState, RunningState, StoppedState)
```

## Components
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior
- **State**: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state
- **ConcreteState**: Implements the behavior associated with a state of the Context

## Benefits
- **Single Responsibility**: Each state class handles behavior for one state
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to add new states without changing existing code
- **State Transitions**: State transitions are explicit and well-defined
- **Eliminates Conditionals**: Replaces large conditional statements with state objects
- **Encapsulation**: State-specific behavior is encapsulated in separate classes

## When to Use
- When an object's behavior depends on its state and the object must change its behavior at runtime
- When you have large conditional statements that depend on the object's state
- When you want to make state transitions explicit and well-defined
- When you want to represent different states as separate classes

## Example
In our car example:
- **Context**: Car class that can be in different states
- **State**: CarState interface
- **ConcreteState**: IdleState, RunningState, StoppedState

This allows the car to behave differently based on its current state (idle, running, stopped) without using complex conditional statements.
