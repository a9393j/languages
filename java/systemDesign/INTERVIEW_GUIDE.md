## Conclusion

System design interviews test your ability to think at scale, understand trade-offs, and communicate complex technical concepts. The key is to:

1. **Clarify requirements** before jumping into solutions
2. **Start simple** and add complexity incrementally
3. **Consider scale** from the beginning
4. **Discuss trade-offs** openly
5. **Plan for failures** and edge cases
6. **Communicate clearly** with diagrams and explanations

Remember that there's often no single "correct" answer in system design. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of distributed systems, scalability principles, and your ability to make informed technical decisions.
